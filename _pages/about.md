# About Me

My current research lies at the intersection of generative modeling, multimodal AI, and visual reasoning, with a particular focus on diffusion-based models and their applications in computer vision.

I completed my **Bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering** at [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en/index), where I am now continuing my journey as a **Ph.D. candidate**.
