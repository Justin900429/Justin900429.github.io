The practice was assigned from the Entrepreneur’s english class in NCTU presented by Prof.Sun. How to let go of being a good person – and become a better person.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } Vocabulary premise: 前述 A previous statement or proposition from which another is inferred or follows as a conclusion. egalitarian: 平均主義 Believing in or based on the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities. Excerption The path of being a good people just begins with letting go of being a a good person. In every other parts of our life, we give ourselves room to grow except in this one which matters most. ReflectionFor us, we always regard “good person” as “perfect”or “helping others”. However, this make us stuck in the so-called bounded ethicality. This keep us from making mistakes which also deprive the choice to learn. In fact, the better person should be those who improve themselves after knowing the mistakes. They learn from their own experience, they grow from those mistakes and go after them. After that, they can find their own mistakes before others claim them. Honestly speaking, before watching the viedo, I still chased to be the “good person”. However, being a “better person” can do more than just being a “good person”. Simply put, better person though is not flawless they always make themselves torward perfect and dedicate themselves to make world better as well. Let’s scan the whole planet with LiDAR | Chris Fisher.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } Vocabulary canopy 遮篷 Ａ cover fixed over a seat or bed, etc. for shelter or decoration. patrimony 遺產 The valuable objects, buildings, ideas, etc. that a society gets from the people who have lived in the past. painstaking 費盡心思的 Extremely careful and correct, and involving a lot of effort. canal 運河 A long, thin stretch of water that is artificially made either for boats to travel along or for taking water from one area to another. mitigate 減輕 To make something less harmful, unpleasant, or bad. Excerption The Earth archive is ultimate gift to future generations. We take for granted that our cultural and ecological patrimony will be around forever. It’t won’t. ReflectionFrom my personal perspective, it is not surprising that archaeologist start to use LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) to reconstruct the historical remains. In fact, in the laboratory, we use LiDAR to build the map for robot to do the exploration. LiDAR has really powerful functionality to simulate the real time environment. It can describe every detail and the most important property - 3D. According to the speaker, there are lots of desctrution on our historical sites. We should take action immediately and face the problems. However, it is hard to prevent both natural and man-made disaster. Instead, LiDAR play the crucial role to record the data of them. Using the data recorded by LiDAR, it is more likely to reconstruct these buildings once they are destroyed. On the other hand, I am, however, deeply convinced that not only government around the world but also global citizens should spare no effort to protect our buildinds. Otherwise, no matter how many LiDAR we have, it will always be insufficient for us to reserve the beauty of our Earth."},{"title":"IT邦幫忙 12屆鐵人賽","date":"2020-08-29T13:27:25.000Z","url":"/2020/08/29/it/it-series/","tags":[["IT","/tags/IT/"]],"categories":[[" ",""]],"content":"這系列是參加 IT 第12屆鐵人賽的文章。 最新[Series - 16] Classification - Logistic Regression - 2 全部 [Series - 0] 參賽前言 [Series - 1] Numpy [Series - 2] Pandas [Series - 3] Matplotlib [Series - 4] Seaborn [Series - 5] 資料種類介紹 [Series - 6] EDA介紹 [Series - 7] 特徵工程介紹 [Series - 8] Python時間轉換介紹 [Series - 9] 實戰演練 [Series - 10] 資料篇總結 [Series - 11] 機器怎麼學習？ [Series - 12] Regression - 1 [Series - 13] Regression - 2 [Series - 14] Regression - 3 [Series - 15] Classification - Logistic Regression - 1 [Series - 16] Classification - Logistic Regression - 2 [Series - 17] Classification - Naive Bayes [Series - 18] Classification - SVM - 1 [Series - 19] Classification - SVM - 2 [Series - 20] Classification - SVM - 3 [Series - 21] Decision tree [Series - 22] Random forest [Series - 23] Boosting - 1 - Adaboost [Series - 24] Boosting - 2 - Gradient Boosting [Series - 25] K-means [Series - 26] Expectation maximization - 1 [Series - 27] Expectation Maximization - 2 - Mixture of Gaussians [Series - 28] Dimension reduction - PCA [Series - 29] Independent Component Analysis [Series - 30] What’s next?
