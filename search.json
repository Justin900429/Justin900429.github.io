How to let go of being a good person – and become a better person.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } Vocabulary premise: 前述 A previous statement or proposition from which another is inferred or follows as a conclusion. egalitarian: 平均主義 Believing in or based on the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities. Excerption The path of being a good people just begins with letting go of being a a good person. In every other parts of our life, we give ourselves room to grow except in this one which matters most. ReflectionFor us, we always regard “good person” as “perfect”or “helping others”. However, this make us stuck in the so-called bounded ethicality. This keep us from making mistakes which also deprive the choice to learn. In fact, the better person should be those who improve themselves after knowing the mistakes. They learn from their own experience, they grow from those mistakes and go after them. After that, they can find their own mistakes before others claim them. Honestly speaking, before watching the viedo, I still chased to be the “good person”. However, being a “better person” can do more than just being a “good person”. Simply put, better person though is not flawless they always make themselves torward perfect and dedicate themselves to make world better as well. Let’s scan the whole planet with LiDAR | Chris Fisher.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } Vocabulary canopy 遮篷 Ａ cover fixed over a seat or bed, etc. for shelter or decoration. patrimony 遺產 The valuable objects, buildings, ideas, etc. that a society gets from the people who have lived in the past. painstaking 費盡心思的 Extremely careful and correct, and involving a lot of effort. canal 運河 A long, thin stretch of water that is artificially made either for boats to travel along or for taking water from one area to another. mitigate 減輕 To make something less harmful, unpleasant, or bad. Excerption The Earth archive is ultimate gift to future generations. We take for granted that our cultural and ecological patrimony will be around forever. It’t won’t. ReflectionFrom my personal perspective, it is not surprising that archaeologist start to use LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) to reconstruct the historical remains. In fact, in the laboratory, we use LiDAR to build the map for robot to do the exploration. LiDAR has really powerful functionality to simulate the real time environment. It can describe every detail and the most important property - 3D. According to the speaker, there are lots of desctrution on our historical sites. We should take action immediately and face the problems. However, it is hard to prevent both natural and man-made disaster. Instead, LiDAR play the crucial role to record the data of them. Using the data recorded by LiDAR, it is more likely to reconstruct these buildings once they are destroyed. On the other hand, I am, however, deeply convinced that not only government around the world but also global citizens should spare no effort to protect our buildinds. Otherwise, no matter how many LiDAR we have, it will always be insufficient for us to reserve the beauty of our Earth. Company Introduction - Shield AI Name: Shield AI Field: AI Robtics Average compensation: $105,000 US (Information from: LADDERS ) Introduction (Exercept from FASTCOMPANY) Service members and first responders willingly go into harm’s way to protect the rest of us. Shield AI’s mission is to protect these heroes via technology that can take over some of the most dangerous parts of their work. Its AI-powered Nova autonomous quadcopter can enter structures, explore them, and stream videos and maps to remote operators, providing essential intelligence without putting humans at unnecessary risk. Reason I’m interested in both AI and robotics which cause me to figure out those top-notch AI robotics companies in the world. Additionally, I eager to learn more about drones and also be more familiar to the company that develop drones to benifit the world. Therefore, I choose to introduce Shield AI. Steve’Jobs 2005 Standford Commencement Address.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } Vocabulary finest 最好的 The best example of its type. unwed 未婚的 Not married (Used especially in newspapers). relented 寬容 To act in a less severe way towards someone and allow something that you had refused to allow before. karma 業障 The force produced by a person’s actions in one life that influences what happens to them in future lives. (In the Buddhist and Hindu religions) hitchhiking 搭便車 To travel by getting free rides in someone else’s vehicle. Excerption Find what you love. Don’t settle. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to go to there. Stay hungry, stay foolished. ReflectionSteve Jobs was a well-known entrepreneur in the world. He was the father of iphone, ipad. These state-of-the-art have changed how people live in the world. Even though he had left us, his spirit are still deeply engraved in our mind. In this viedo, Steve Jobs gave a speech to the student who were going to graduate from Standford in 2005. He only told those students three stroies. However, the story he conveyed was really valuable. We could easily observe that he was really special then other people. He left the college and start his own enterprise in the garage. He always knew what to do and what he wanted to. Even when he facing the challenges, he could find a way to conquer them. “Stay hungry, stay foolish”. This was the final note that Steve Jobs gave. We should always stay ambitious to our goal. Find the opportunity not just wait for the opportunity. This is what I always bear in mind."},{"title":"Machine learing series","date":"2020-08-29T13:27:25.000Z","url":"/2020/08/29/it/it-series/","tags":[["AI","/tags/AI/"]],"categories":[[" ",""]],"content":"全部 [Series - 0] 參賽前言 [Series - 1] Numpy [Series - 2] Pandas [Series - 3] Matplotlib [Series - 4] Seaborn [Series - 5] 資料種類介紹 [Series - 6] EDA介紹 [Series - 7] 特徵工程介紹 [Series - 8] Python時間轉換介紹 [Series - 9] 實戰演練 [Series - 10] 資料篇總結 [Series - 11] 機器怎麼學習？ [Series - 12] Regression - 1 [Series - 13] Regression - 2 [Series - 14] Regression - 3 [Series - 15] Classification - Logistic Regression - 1 [Series - 16] Classification - Logistic Regression - 2 [Series - 17] Classification - Naive Bayes [Series - 18] Classification - SVM - 1 [Series - 19] Classification - SVM - 2 [Series - 20] Classification - SVM - 3 [Series - 21] Decision tree [Series - 22] Random forest [Series - 23] Boosting - 1 - Adaboost [Series - 24] Boosting - 2 - Gradient Boosting [Series - 25] K-means [Series - 26] Expectation maximization - 1 [Series - 27] Expectation Maximization - 2 - Mixture of Gaussians [Series - 28] Dimension reduction - PCA [Series - 29] Independent Component Analysis [Series - 30] What’s next?
