How to let go of being a good person – and become a better person.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } Vocabulary premise: 前述 A previous statement or proposition from which another is inferred or follows as a conclusion. egalitarian: 平均主義 Believing in or based on the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities. Excerption The path of being a good people just begins with letting go of being a a good person. In every other parts of our life, we give ourselves room to grow except in this one which matters most. ReflectionFor us, we always regard “good person” as “perfect”or “helping others”. However, this make us stuck in the so-called bounded ethicality. This keep us from making mistakes which also deprive the choice to learn. In fact, the better person should be those who improve themselves after knowing the mistakes. They learn from their own experience, they grow from those mistakes and go after them. After that, they can find their own mistakes before others claim them. Honestly speaking, before watching the viedo, I still chased to be the “good person”. However, being a “better person” can do more than just being a “good person”. Simply put, better person though is not flawless they always make themselves torward perfect and dedicate themselves to make world better as well."},{"title":"IT邦幫忙 12屆鐵人賽","date":"2020-08-29T13:27:25.000Z","url":"/2020/08/29/it/it-series/","tags":[["IT","/tags/IT/"]],"categories":[[" ",""]],"content":"這系列是參加 IT 第12屆鐵人賽的文章。 最新[Series - 16] Classification - Logistic Regression - 2 全部 [Series - 0] 參賽前言 [Series - 1] Numpy [Series - 2] Pandas [Series - 3] Matplotlib [Series - 4] Seaborn [Series - 5] 資料種類介紹 [Series - 6] EDA介紹 [Series - 7] 特徵工程介紹 [Series - 8] Python時間轉換介紹 [Series - 9] 實戰演練 [Series - 10] 資料篇總結 [Series - 11] 機器怎麼學習？ [Series - 12] Regression - 1 [Series - 13] Regression - 2 [Series - 14] Regression - 3 [Series - 15] Classification - Logistic Regression - 1 [Series - 16] Classification - Logistic Regression - 2 [Series - 17] Classification - Naive Bayes [Series - 18] Classification - SVM - 1 [Series - 19] Classification - SVM - 2 [Series - 20] Classification - SVM - 3 [Series - 21] Decision tree [Series - 22] Random forest [Series - 23] Boosting - 1 - Adaboost [Series - 24] Boosting - 2 - Gradient Boosting [Series - 25] K-means [Series - 26] Expectation maximization - 1 [Series - 27] Expectation Maximization - 2 - Mixture of Gaussians [Series - 28] Dimension reduction - PCA [Series - 29] Independent Component Analysis [Series - 30] What’s next?
