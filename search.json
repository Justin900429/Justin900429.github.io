How to let go of being a good person – and become a better person Vocabulary premise: 前述 A previous statement or proposition from which another is inferred or follows as a conclusion. egalitarian: 平均主義 Believing in or based on the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities. Excerption The path of being a good people just begins with letting go of being a a good person. In every other parts of our life, we give ourselves room to grow except in this one which matters most. ReflectionFor us, we always regard “good person” as “perfect”or “helping others”. However, this make us stuck in the so-called bounded ethicality. This keep us from making mistakes which also deprive the choice to learn. In fact, the better person should be those who improve themselves after knowing the mistakes. They learn from their own experience, they grow from those mistakes and go after them. After that, they can find their own mistakes before others claim them. Honestly speaking, before watching the viedo, I still chased to be the “good person”. However, being a “better person” can do more than just being a “good person”. Simply put, better person though is not flawless they always make themselves torward perfect and dedicate themselves to make world better as well. Let’s scan the whole planet with LiDAR | Chris Fisher Vocabulary canopy 遮篷 Ａ cover fixed over a seat or bed, etc. for shelter or decoration. patrimony 遺產 The valuable objects, buildings, ideas, etc. that a society gets from the people who have lived in the past. painstaking 費盡心思的 Extremely careful and correct, and involving a lot of effort. canal 運河 A long, thin stretch of water that is artificially made either for boats to travel along or for taking water from one area to another. mitigate 減輕 To make something less harmful, unpleasant, or bad. Excerption The Earth archive is ultimate gift to future generations. We take for granted that our cultural and ecological patrimony will be around forever. It’t won’t. ReflectionFrom my personal perspective, it is not surprising that archaeologist start to use LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) to reconstruct the historical remains. In fact, in the laboratory, we use LiDAR to build the map for robot to do the exploration. LiDAR has really powerful functionality to simulate the real time environment. It can describe every detail and the most important property - 3D. According to the speaker, there are lots of desctrution on our historical sites. We should take action immediately and face the problems. However, it is hard to prevent both natural and man-made disaster. Instead, LiDAR play the crucial role to record the data of them. Using the data recorded by LiDAR, it is more likely to reconstruct these buildings once they are destroyed. On the other hand, I am, however, deeply convinced that not only government around the world but also global citizens should spare no effort to protect our buildinds. Otherwise, no matter how many LiDAR we have, it will always be insufficient for us to reserve the beauty of our Earth.

Shield AI’s mission is to protect these heroes via technology that can take over some of the most dangerous parts of their work. Its AI-powered Nova autonomous quadcopter can enter structures, explore them, and stream videos and maps to remote operators, providing essential intelligence without putting humans at unnecessary risk. Reason I’m interested in both AI and robotics which cause me to figure out those top-notch AI robotics companies in the world.

Steve Jobs 2005 Standford Commencement Address Vocabulary finest 最好的 The best example of its type. unwed 未婚的 Not married (Used especially in newspapers). relented 寬容 To act in a less severe way towards someone and allow something that you had refused to allow before. karma 業障 The force produced by a person’s actions in one life that influences what happens to them in future lives. (In the Buddhist and Hindu religions) hitchhiking 搭便車 To travel by getting free rides in someone else’s vehicle. Excerption Find what you love. Don’t settle. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to go to there. Stay hungry, stay foolished. ReflectionSteve Jobs was a well-known entrepreneur in the world. He was the father of iphone, ipad. These state-of-the-art have changed how people live in the world. Even though he had left us, his spirit are still deeply engraved in our mind. In this viedo, Steve Jobs gave a speech to the student who were going to graduate from Standford in 2005. He only told those students three stroies. However, the story he conveyed was really valuable. We could easily observe that he was really special then other people. He left the college and start his own enterprise in the garage. He always knew what to do and what he wanted to. Even when he facing the challenges, he could find a way to conquer them. “Stay hungry, stay foolish”. This was the final note that Steve Jobs gave. We should always stay ambitious to our goal. Find the opportunity not just wait for the opportunity. This is what I always bear in mind. How can the stock market be booming while millions are out of work? vocabulary index 指標 A sign or measure of something. disproportion 不相稱 The fact of being too large or too small in relation to something else. Dow 道瓊指數 Index of the economy. S&amp;P 標準普爾500指數 Index of the economy. layoff 解僱 An occasion when a company stops employing someone, sometimes temporarily, because the company does not have enough money or enough work barometer 標誌 Something that can show how a particular situation is developing, or how people’s opinions on a particular matter are changing Excerption Stock ownership is highly concentrated among the wealthy. Unemployment rate isn’t like that it’s actullay the opposite. It’s a lagging indicator so changed in the economy it take times for them to manifest itself into the unemployment In the first quarter of 2020, the wealthiest 10% of US households owned 87% of all stocks. ReflectionUnder the attack of the covid19, the world have been seriously impacted. The virus have not only taken tolls on life but also the economy. Therefore, we may wonder the stock price might decay right now. However, after finishing this viedo, I realized that the crucial thing to decide the bad or good are not those unemployment, wages. By contrast, they use indices such as Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 to evaluate whether our stock market is placeing in a good place or not. One of the reason is “Stock ownership is highly concentrated among the wealthy”. This seems to be the common sense but this actually affect how the stock market fluctuates. If those people decide to buy or sell out the stock, it definetely will have some serious influence. For the other reason is the “Tech company”. Among all the stock, the stock of those tech company such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft will be more valuable then others because they control the market around the world. On the other hand, the stock market in Taiwan was cloudy then. Recently, the stock market have gradually gotten back to the right place. The reason may be of little difference than USA. Some of them may be the trade war and the Triple coupon. How to develop a Business Idea: Crash Course Business - Entrepreneur ship #2 Vocabulary upcycled 升級 Reused in such a way as to create a product of higher quality or value than the original. clunky 笨拙的 Awkardly solid, heavily, and outdated. sleek 光滑 Smooth and glossy. Excerption Innovative ideas can be traced to three main sources: our passions, our complaints, and our egos. Most lenders care about your story, proof your idea works and is wanted, an understanding of your customers, and your financial plan, which often takes 5-10 pages. ReflectionAfter finishing this viedo, I feel eager to finish all the series to know more about the entrepreneurship! In this series, the speakers told us about lots of knowledge with respect to entrepreneur such as developing a Business idea, value proposition and customer segments and some rules of the business. In this viedo, we learn how to plan a business idea what is more important and how to present it. In fact, it also told us that most of the people think that writing lots of pages is more important. However, what matters most is the content in the pages. We don’t have to write lots of thing, instead, we just have to show our objective, how we’re going to develop our product and the most important our enthusiasm. Therefore, the pages of our proposal should limit to 5 to 10 pages. Additionally, other things that we have to put our eyes on is that we should show our plan idea with our customers! We have to let our customers know what is the new thing and also we can get some feedback from customers. Hence, we can promote our product before it actully released! TikTok Business Model - What Makes It So Popular Vocabulary syncing 同步 A state in which things happen at the same time or in the same way, or are suited to each other: censorship 審查制度 The practice of censoring. allegation 指控 A statement, made without giving proof, that someone has done something wrong or illegal. Excerption If the video is really good, it can go viral and the Creator doesn’t need to have any followers in the first place. TikTok mainly earns money by showing viedo ads to its viewer in their feed and when businesses do them correctly, you might not even realize that you’re looking at an ad. ReflectionAfter finishing the video, I was quite shocked about the advantage of the Tiktok and how the businiess model they implemented. The author mainly focus on the value propositions and the customer segments. Especially, the value propositions was made by lots of stretegies. For example, Tiktok has the low barrier for the creator and organic discovery to help those creators become popular. These was really attractive for those who wanted to be seen. Comparing to those famous social media, the creator don’t have to know lots of technique about editting. Instead, they just have to come up an idea of how to present their video in a funny way. Additionally, due to the content network effect, creators can know what is popular know and further create their own version to be with it. In fact, the above description only showed the aspect of the creator. There are still different aspect to observe the business model such as viewers or advertisers. On the other hands, Tiktok provides the revenue stream for creators to earn money by creating video. If they put ads in their videos, they can get some feedback when viewrs watch their video. The more the viewers watch, the more money the creators earn. Coronavirus outbreak: The economic impact explained Vocabulary high-end 高價位的 Intended for people who want very good quality products and who do not mind how much they cost hysteria 歇斯底里 Extreme fear, excitement, anger, etc. that cannot be controlled slash 劈，砍 To cut with a sharp blade using a quick, strong movement crunch 嘎吱地咬嚼 To crush hard food loudly between the teeth, or to make a sound as if something is being crushed or broken wrestle 搏鬥 Struggle with a difficulty or problem. Excerption The spread of the corona virus has pushed the pause button on one of the world’s biggest economic powerhouses. How the corona virus will truely impact the world economy will heavily depend not only on its severity or duration but also on whether consumers start to change their spending behaviors based on that fear. ReflectionIn this viedo, the speakers first traced back to 2008 which was the outbreak of the SARS. He told about the GDP that China occupied in that time was only 4%. However, in nowadays, China has already deeped himself to the supply chain which contributes 16%. In fact, the supply chain would be effected due to the collapse of the factories. In modern society, China has the massive supple web that we couldn’t live without it. Everything we used, we worn were mainly produced in China. However, the spread of the covid 19 has forced the pause the on supply chain. For example, we know that the source of iphone was mainly produced by China. The influence of the covid 19 has made the iphone’s supply chain dropped dramatically. Additionally, airpods pro was low on invertory in the early stage in 2020. The huge impact of coronavirus on world has indeed cause lots of inconvinient to the people. However, the better way to wheather the storm is to protect ourselves and others. The vanccine of the coronavirus is not created now but I am deeply convinced that we can conquer the challenge altogether! Why “C” Students Are More Successful Than “A” Students Vocabulary baffle 使困惑 To cause someone to be completely unable to understand or explain something. get-go 開端 The beginning, when someone starts to do something, or a process starts submissive 順從的 In a way that allows yourself to be controlled by other people regurgitate 不加思地考重複 If you regurgitate facts, you just repeat what you have heard without thinking about it. reprimand 訓斥 To express to someone your strong official disapproval of them unorthdox 非正統的 Different from what is usual or expected in behaviour, ideas, methods, etc. Excerption Instead of focusing on the grades, focus on your passion in life and in getting the skills and knowledge you need to achieve your goals and make dreams come true. ReflectionAfter finishing the video, I partially disagreed what the author just mentioned. In fact, this video would totally convey the wrong messages to those who watched it. The success was not about the grade is true, however, that doesn’t always mean that “A” student will always be submissive and regurgitate. Additionally, the video will make those who got “C” become more passive and always think they will become success because they were “C” which they already have equipped with those personalities. They won’t think that they should try their best to become active and become powerful. Although the video had told the reason why the “C” student would get success, that doesn’t mean the “A” student will lack of those personalities. Instead, in my opinion, most of the “A” students have equipped those traits because they know what they wonna do in their life! The best way to encourge poeple, is to try tell them “Don’t be so worried about the grades. The grades matters, but it doesn’t mean all of your life.” Then we can start to talk about the traits of those successful students. In fact, those who succeeded shared the same personalities - they dreamed and they persued. There is a logical error called survivorship bias. It told about that we were concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. In this viedo, we overlooked those success “A” students and only concentrated on “C” students. In fact, there were lots of “C” students failed to realize their dream but we didn’t take them into consideration. Simply put, what “really” matters are our dreams, our personalities and our ideas. We should always keep cultivating the critical and innovative thinking. The Most Successful People Explain Why a College Degree is USELESS Vocabulary binge 無節制地行為 To do something in a way that is extreme and not controlled. palm tree 棕櫚樹 A tree growing in warm regions and having a tall, straight trunk, no branches, and a mass of long, pointed leaves at the top prod 促使 To encourage someone to take action, esp. when the person is slow or unwilling. heterogeneous 各式各樣的 Consisting of different parts or types. indulgence 放縱 The attitude of allowing yourself or someone else to have something enjoyable, or the act of having something enjoyable. Excerption They read a bunch of Words, I’ve lived a bunch of life. ReflectionFirst of all, I have to clearify that I felt stronly disagree to this video but not what those people told in the video. In fact, this video would definitely mislead lots of person due to the wrong concept that becoming the successful person. In fact, the degree doesn’t matter most, but that doesn’t mean that the degree is useless. For some people, the degree represent the resource for them to learn, to think and to cultivate the expertise. However, due to the “Editing”, this video quite like conveying that you don’t have to learning because the college or university degree is useless. The reason why those people is success is the only key point for people to learn! Not just about the comment that those people gave to the degree. Also, this kind of video is another kind of survivorship bias. Therefore, I really hate these kind of video because they always convey the wrong concept to others. No offense, if I gonna to choose the video to watch, I will choose more constructive one. For example like “how to cultivate the right attitude toward life”, or “Besides degree, where can we learn”. Simply put, the thing for people to learn to success is the attitude not the comment on the degree. How to manage your time more effectively (according to machines) - Brian Christian Vocabulary iconic 非常出名的 Very famous or popular, especially being considered to represent particular opinions or a particular time consolation 安慰 Something that makes someone who is sad or disappointed feel better counterintuitive 反直覺的 Something that is counter-intuitive does not happen in the way you would expect it to coalesce 聯合 If two or more things coalesce, they come or grow together to form one thing or system. Excerption One of the first insight is that all the time you spend prioritizing you work is time you aren’t spending doing it. ReflectionThis video use some special way to talk about the time management. The author use the metaphor to talk about how the computer do the management efficiently and to convey how we human can do. To be more precise, the author use how the operating system works to explain how can human do the time managemnt. In the first example, the author implied that we human often spend less time doing and more time prioritizing. However, this waste lots of time. Instead, we can do it randomly of in choronologically to safe the time finding which is the most important one. However, although this approach should work. We sometime still need to decide which thing is most important to finish. Furthermore, we should cut down the time to be interrupted. Because everytime when we stopped our tasks, our mind will relax and need time to restart the work. This will cost us lots of time to get back to the place and continue doing the works. The last but not least, if we have to be interrupted, group interruptions by how long we can afford to not do them and then do them in that amount of time. Therefore, we still can do all the other things in a time and won’t spend lots of time to restart the work. Additionally, all the concept above was excerpted from a booked cann Algorithm to live by. After watching the video, I felt highly interested to the book and decided to by the book! Introduce an interesting English-speaking YouTuber. Vocabulary No vocabulary unknow in the video. Excertption Wandering around a random forest. I won’t get lost because fo StatQeust! ReflectionI really like StatQuest due to his outstanding personalities. He teached lots of Statistic, Machine learning and other knowledge on Youtube. However, the most different things between he and others is that he always use very easiest way to explain the difficult thing and also make lots of video to illustrate the concept. Especially, he like to sing. Therefore, he will always make some song and put it at the beginning of the video. The content of song will related to the topic he is going to talk about. Among the video, he will use “BAMN” to show something amazing. If the thing is super amazing, he will use “DOUBLE BAMN” or “TRIPLE BAMN”. On the other hand, he always try to help people understand some difficult concept and trying to make the animation to show how each step works. We always can notice he will interact with the viewers in the comment block. Overall, I have learned lots of things from his channel. Additionally, I will share his YouTube channel to more people and make more people to know about him! This company makes sure you never run out of coffee Vocabulary roaster 烘焙廠 A person or company that roasts a particular food. lotion 護膚油 A liquid that you put on your skin in order to protect it, improve its condition, or make it smell pleasant. Excerption In the future, what I see is people are just gonna have this type of service that is just gonna be able to tell when they need something and eventually get everything to them at the right time. ReflectionThe idea given from the video is really powerful and useful in our daily life. As the interviewers said, we always wonder there were a system to help us track the amount of items they we need and reorder them. Although they currently made only for the coffee, the idea can be spreaded to everything in our daily life. In fact, there are smart refrigerator that can do the same thing! If the food drop down to a threshold, it will help us reorder the things. This kind of technique is called Internet of things(IOT). We connect the device to the internet and get the data from the cloud to analysis the current situation. Thanks to advancement of the technology that make our life more convenient. Startup Funding Explained: Everything You Need to Know Vocabulary dilute 沖淡, 減緩 To make something less strong or less valuable Excerption In the US, an cooperating acompany will set you back anything between 25 dollars and a few thousand dollars. Usually, the Angels and VCs don’t care much for the businesss plan, they want to see if the team is competent, the ideas is it special? ReflectionThis viedo told us about the concept about the funding. First, it told us what we should do before we start setting up the company and the amount of the money to build the system. It told lots about the shares, how the investors will be like. How can we raise our funds as well. Honestly, this video is quite hard for me to understand all the conecpt. Even I watched it twice, something still confused me. However, I still was able to learn some new things. Such as how can the investors get the shares and how can we seperate the shares to the money. Especially, how can we avoid diluting our money and difference kind of investors such as Angle inverstors and VCs. Audiobooks - The Little Prince - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry Vocabulary absurd 荒謬的 Stupid and unreasonable, or silly in a humorous way ram 猛撞 To hit or push something with force peal 大聲鳴響 A long loud sound or series of sounds, especially of laughter or thunder Excerption After a thoughtful silence, he answered the good thing about the crate you’ve given me is that he can use it for a house after dark. ReflectionThis is my first time to listen to the audio book on YouTube. In fact, I felt little bored at it and decided to stop listening it after finding the vocabulary that I didn’t recognize. Additionally, I couldn’t even realize what just the author said about the story. I knew that Little Prince is really famous and already adapted to movie. However, I have never seen or read it before. Maybe I will read it to my kids as a bed story. Instead of listening to the audio book, I will decide to listen to the Podcast. The topic I choosed will related to Technology, Financial. Another reason I don’t like to listen to the audio book is because the time is too long for me! I can simply find the book and read it by myself. After all, this is still a special experience for me."},{"title":"Machine learning series","date":"2020-08-29T13:27:25.000Z","url":"/posts/f9a1d882/","tags":[["algorithm","/tags/algorithm/"],["AI","/tags/AI/"],["ML","/tags/ML/"],["Python","/tags/Python/"]],"categories":[[" ",""]],"content":"全部 [Series - 0] 參賽前言 [Series - 1] Numpy [Series - 2] Pandas [Series - 3] Matplotlib [Series - 4] Seaborn [Series - 5] 資料種類介紹 [Series - 6] EDA介紹 [Series - 7] 特徵工程介紹 [Series - 8] Python時間轉換介紹 [Series - 9] 實戰演練 [Series - 10] 資料篇總結 [Series - 11] 機器怎麼學習？ [Series - 12] Regression - 1 [Series - 13] Regression - 2 [Series - 14] Regression - 3 [Series - 15] Classification - Logistic Regression - 1 [Series - 16] Classification - Logistic Regression - 2 [Series - 17] Classification - Naive Bayes [Series - 18] Classification - SVM - 1 [Series - 19] Classification - SVM - 2 [Series - 20] Classification - SVM - 3 [Series - 21] Decision tree [Series - 22] Random forest [Series - 23] Boosting - 1 - Adaboost [Series - 24] Boosting - 2 - Gradient Boosting [Series - 25] K-means [Series - 26] Expectation maximization - 1 [Series - 27] Expectation Maximization - 2 - Mixture of Gaussians [Series - 28] Dimension reduction - PCA [Series - 29] Independent Component Analysis [Series - 30] What’s next?
