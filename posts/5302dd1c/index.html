<h3 id="Reflection"><a href="#Reflection" class="headerlink" title="Reflection"></a>Reflection</h3><p>For us, we always regard “good person” as “perfect”or “helping others”. However, this make us stuck in the so-called bounded ethicality. This keep us from making mistakes which also deprive the choice to learn. </p>
<p>In fact, the better person should be those who improve themselves after knowing the mistakes. They learn from their own experience, they grow from those mistakes and go after them. After that, they can find their own mistakes before others claim them.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, before watching the viedo, I still chased to be the “good person”. However, being a “better person” can do more than just being a “good person”. Simply put, better person though is not flawless they always make themselves torward perfect and dedicate themselves to make world better as well.</p>

<h3 id="Reflection-1"><a href="#Reflection-1" class="headerlink" title="Reflection"></a>Reflection</h3><p>From my personal perspective, it is not surprising that archaeologist start to use <strong>LiDAR</strong> (<strong>L</strong>ight <strong>D</strong>etection <strong>a</strong>nd <strong>R</strong>anging) to reconstruct the historical remains. In fact, in the laboratory, we use LiDAR to build the map for robot to do the exploration.</p>
<p><strong>LiDAR</strong> has really powerful functionality to simulate the real time environment. It can describe every detail and the most important property - 3D.</p>
<p>According to the speaker, there are lots of desctrution on our historical sites. We should take action immediately and face the problems. However, it is hard to prevent both natural and man-made disaster. </p>
<p>Instead, <strong>LiDAR</strong> play the crucial role to record the data of them. Using the data recorded by <strong>LiDAR</strong>, it is more likely to reconstruct these buildings once they are destroyed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I am, however, deeply convinced that not only government around the world but also global citizens should spare no effort to protect our buildinds. Otherwise, no matter how many <strong>LiDAR</strong> we have, it will always be insufficient for us to reserve the beauty of our Earth.</p>

<h3 id="Reflection-2"><a href="#Reflection-2" class="headerlink" title="Reflection"></a>Reflection</h3><p>Steve Jobs was a well-known entrepreneur in the world. He was the father of iphone, ipad. These state-of-the-art have changed how people live in the world. Even though he had left us, his spirit are still deeply engraved in our mind.</p>
<p>In this viedo, Steve Jobs gave a speech to the student who were going to graduate from Standford in 2005. He only told those students three stroies. However, the story he conveyed was really valuable.</p>
<p>We could easily observe that he was really special then other people. He left the college and start his own enterprise in the garage. He always knew what to do and what he wanted to. Even when he facing the challenges, he could find a way to conquer them.</p>
<p>“Stay hungry, stay foolish”. This was the final note that Steve Jobs gave. We should always stay ambitious to our goal. Find the opportunity not just wait for the opportunity. This is what I always bear in mind.</p>

<h3 id="Reflection-3"><a href="#Reflection-3" class="headerlink" title="Reflection"></a>Reflection</h3><p>Under the attack of the covid19, the world have been seriously impacted. The virus have not only taken tolls on life but also the economy. Therefore, we may wonder the stock price might decay right now.</p>
<p>However, after finishing this viedo, I realized that the crucial thing to decide the bad or good are not those unemployment, wages. By contrast, they use indices such as Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 to evaluate whether our stock market is placeing in a good place or not.</p>
<p>One of the reason is “Stock ownership is highly concentrated among the wealthy”. This seems to be the common sense but this actually affect how the stock market fluctuates. If those people decide to buy or sell out the stock, it definetely will have some serious influence.</p>
<p>For the other reason is the “Tech company”. Among all the stock, the stock of those tech company such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft will be more valuable then others because they control the market around the world.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the stock market in Taiwan was cloudy then. Recently, the stock market have gradually gotten back to the right place. The reason may be of little difference than USA. Some of them may be the trade war and the Triple coupon.</p>

<p>In this viedo, we learn how to plan a business idea what is more important and how to present it. In fact, it also told us that most of the people think that writing lots of pages is more important. However, what matters most is the content in the pages.</p>
<p>We don’t have to write lots of thing, instead, we just have to show our objective, how we’re going to develop our product and the most important our enthusiasm. Therefore, the pages of our proposal should limit to 5 to 10 pages.</p>
<p>Additionally, other things that we have to put our eyes on is that we should show our plan idea with our customers! We have to let our customers know what is the new thing and also we can get some feedback from customers. Hence, we can promote our product before it actully released!</p>

<h3 id="Reflection-5"><a href="#Reflection-5" class="headerlink" title="Reflection"></a>Reflection</h3><p>After finishing the video, I was quite shocked about the advantage of the Tiktok and how the businiess model they implemented. The author mainly focus on the <strong>value propositions</strong> and the <strong>customer segments</strong>.</p>
<p>Especially, the <strong>value propositions</strong> was made by lots of stretegies. For example, Tiktok has the <strong>low barrier</strong> for the creator and <strong>organic discovery</strong> to help those creators become popular. These was really attractive for those who wanted to be seen.</p>
<p>Comparing to those famous social media, the creator don’t have to know lots of technique about editting. Instead, they just have to come up an idea of how to present their video in a funny way. Additionally, due to the content network effect, creators can know what is popular know and further create their own version to be with it.</p>
<p>In fact, the above description only showed the aspect of the creator. There are still different aspect to observe the business model such as viewers or advertisers. On the other hands, Tiktok provides the revenue stream for creators to earn money by creating video.</p>
<p>If they put ads in their videos, they can get some feedback when viewrs watch their video. The more the viewers watch, the more money the creators earn.</p>

<h3 id="Reflection-6"><a href="#Reflection-6" class="headerlink" title="Reflection"></a>Reflection</h3><p>In this viedo, the speakers first traced back to 2008 which was the outbreak of the SARS. He told about the GDP that China occupied in that time was only 4%. However, in nowadays, China has already deeped himself to the supply chain which contributes 16%.</p>
<p>In fact, the supply chain would be effected due to the collapse of the factories. In modern society, China has the massive supple web that we couldn’t live without it. Everything we used, we worn were mainly produced in China. However, the spread of the covid 19 has forced the pause the on supply chain.</p>
<p>For example, we know that the source of iphone was mainly produced by China. The influence of the covid 19 has made the iphone’s supply chain dropped dramatically. Additionally, airpods pro was low on invertory in the early stage in 2020.</p>
<p>The huge impact of coronavirus on world has indeed cause lots of inconvinient to the people. However, the better way to wheather the storm is to protect ourselves and others. The vanccine of the coronavirus is not created now but I am deeply convinced that we can conquer the challenge altogether!</p>

<p>Instead of focusing on the grades, focus on your passion in life and in getting the skills and knowledge you need to achieve your goals and make dreams come true.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Reflection-7"><a href="#Reflection-7" class="headerlink" title="Reflection"></a>Reflection</h3><p>After finishing the video, I partially disagreed what the author just mentioned. In fact, this video would totally convey the wrong messages to those who watched it. The success was not about the grade is true, however, that doesn’t always mean that “A” student will always be submissive and regurgitate.</p>
<p>Additionally, the video will make those who got “C” become more passive and always think they will become success because they were “C” which they already have equipped with those personalities. They won’t think that they should try their best to become active and become powerful.</p>
<p>Although the video had told the reason why the “C” student would get success, that doesn’t mean the “A” student will lack of those personalities. Instead, in my opinion, most of the “A” students have equipped those traits because they know what they wonna do in their life!</p>
<p>The best way to encourge poeple, is to try tell them “Don’t be so worried about the grades. The grades matters, but it doesn’t mean all of your life.” Then we can start to talk about the traits of those successful students. In fact, those who succeeded shared the same personalities - they dreamed and they persued.</p>
<p>There is a logical error called <strong>survivorship bias</strong>. It told about that we were concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. In this viedo, we overlooked those success “A” students and only concentrated on “C” students. In fact, there were lots of “C” students failed to realize their dream but we didn’t take them into consideration.</p>
<p>Simply put, what “really” matters are our dreams, our personalities and our ideas. We should always keep cultivating the critical and innovative thinking.</p>

<h3 id="Reflection-8"><a href="#Reflection-8" class="headerlink" title="Reflection"></a>Reflection</h3><p>First of all, I have to clearify that I felt stronly disagree to this video but not what those people told in the video. In fact, this video would definitely mislead lots of person due to the wrong concept that becoming the successful person.</p>
<p>In fact, the degree doesn’t matter most, but that doesn’t mean that the degree is useless. For some people, the degree represent the resource for them to learn, to think and to cultivate the expertise. However, due to the <strong>“Editing”</strong>, this video quite like conveying that you don’t have to learning because the college or university degree is useless.</p>
<p>The reason why those people is success is the only key point for people to learn! Not just about the comment that those people gave to the degree. Also, this kind of video is another kind of survivorship bias. Therefore, I really hate these kind of video because they always convey the wrong concept to others.</p>
<p>No offense, if I gonna to choose the video to watch, I will choose more constructive one. For example like “how to cultivate the right attitude toward life”, or “Besides degree, where can we learn”. Simply put, the thing for people to learn to success is the attitude not the comment on the degree.</p>

<p>One of the first insight is that all the time you spend prioritizing you work is time you aren’t spending doing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Reflection-9"><a href="#Reflection-9" class="headerlink" title="Reflection"></a>Reflection</h3><p>This video use some special way to talk about the time management. The author use the metaphor to talk about how the computer do the management efficiently and to convey how we human can do. To be more precise, the author use how the operating system works to explain how can human do the time managemnt.</p>
<p>In the first example, the author implied that we human often spend less time doing and more time prioritizing. However, this waste lots of time. Instead, we can do it randomly of in choronologically to safe the time finding which is the most important one. However, although this approach should work. We sometime still need to decide which thing is most important to finish.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should cut down the time to be interrupted. Because everytime when we stopped our tasks, our mind will relax and need time to restart the work. This will cost us lots of time to get back to the place and continue doing the works.</p>
<p>The last but not least, if we have to be interrupted, group interruptions by how long we can afford to not do them and then do them in that amount of time. Therefore, we still can do all the other things in a time and won’t spend lots of time to restart the work.</p>
<p>Additionally, all the concept above was excerpted from a booked cann <strong>Algorithm to live by</strong>. After watching the video, I felt highly interested to the book and decided to by the book!</p>

<h3 id="Reflection-10"><a href="#Reflection-10" class="headerlink" title="Reflection"></a>Reflection</h3><p>I really like StatQuest due to his outstanding personalities. He teached lots of Statistic, Machine learning and other knowledge on Youtube. However, the most different things between he and others is that he always use very easiest way to explain the difficult thing and also make lots of video to illustrate the concept.</p>
<p>Especially, he like to sing. Therefore, he will always make some song and put it at the beginning of the video. The content of song will related to the topic he is going to talk about. Among the video, he will  use <strong>“BAMN”</strong> to show something amazing. If the thing is super amazing, he will use <strong>“DOUBLE BAMN”</strong> or <strong>“TRIPLE BAMN”</strong>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he always try to help people understand some difficult concept and trying to make the animation to show how each step works. We always can notice he will interact with the viewers in the comment block.</p>
<p>Overall, I have learned lots of things from his channel. Additionally, I will share his YouTube channel to more people and make more people to know about him!</p>

<p>Although they currently made only for the coffee, the idea can be spreaded to everything in our daily life. In fact, there are smart refrigerator that can do the same thing! If the food drop down to a threshold, it will help us reorder the things.</p>
<p>This kind of technique is called Internet of things(IOT). We connect the device to the internet and get the data from the cloud to analysis the current situation. Thanks to advancement of the technology that make our life more convenient.</p>

Additionally, I couldn’t even realize what just the author said about the story.</p>
<p>I knew that Little Prince is really famous and already adapted to movie. However, I have never seen or read it before. Maybe I will read it to my kids as a bed story. Instead of listening to the audio book, I will decide to listen to the Podcast. The topic I choosed will related to Technology, Financial.</p>
<p>Another reason I don’t like to listen to the audio book is because the time is too long for me! I can simply find the book and read it by myself. After all, this is still a special experience for me.</p>
